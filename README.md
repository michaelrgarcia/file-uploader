# file-uploader

Another Typescript Express server that exercises basic authentication concepts with Passport. Uses ejs for views. Also my first go-around with an ORM (Prisma).

## Usage

Run `npm i` after cloning. Then, run `npm run start` to start the server. Types will be checked on pre-commit.

(Consider adding a linting script to the CI pipeline.)
